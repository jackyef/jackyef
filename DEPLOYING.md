## Deploying

1. Install `vercel` cli
```
yarn global add vercel
```

2. Run the cli
```
vc
```

3. Link the project to an existing vercel project, or create a new one.

4. Deploy by running `vc --prod`


## Why not just integrate with the GitHub repo?
Since the GitHub repo will be updating the `readme.md` very often, the 
re-deployment can happen too many times.
